For this project, we were asked to build a dashboard in Tableau with whatever data we wanted. I used a dataset that I had previously used in SQL, so I pulled the data directly from the pgAdmin server into Tableau.

After joining the tables in Tableau, I specifically wanted to look for trends related to emotions and character count across students in all grade levels and all genders.
